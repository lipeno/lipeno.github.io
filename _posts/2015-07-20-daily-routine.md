Probably the most important period of your day is when you just wake up in the morning. If you’re rolling out of bed after hitting snooze a dozen times, you’re doing it wrong.
Your morning routine can set you up for success the whole day. You can chose to linger in bed while dreading the alarm, or you can set yourself up for productivity and success with the introduction of a simple routine that will set the tone for everything you’ll accomplish that day.

Working remotely and being self-employed has many advantages to the quality of life, but it does introduce certain challenges, especially when moving often and working from different cities and workspaces. 
When you are your own boss it is important to have and keep a discipline to become more productive at work on one side but also to live a healthy life on the other.
To do this, it can help to introduce some routine to everyday life, as discussed by successful people like Tim Ferris, Tony Robbins and Hal Elrod.

After digging into the science behind daily routines and learning about daily routines of successful people I have experimented to figure out what works the best for me. While not all of the same stuff will work for you, hopefully it can help to build your own routine which can take only a few minutes per day but have a great impact to your life.
